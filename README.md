# XMR Algorithmic Trading

An indie quant project to (hopefully!) find alpha on Monero (XMR).

## Why XMR?

THESIS: Monero's privacy architecture creates a unique challenge for technical analysis: unlike transparent blockchains where on-chain metrics reveal accumulation patterns and whale movements, XMR's opaque ledger means price action and exchange data contain all available public information. This makes machine learning particularly valuable - an XGBoost ensemble can detect subtle patterns in how XMR behaves during different market regimes that would be invisible to manual indicator analysis.

The core insight: Monero correlates with Bitcoin during normal market conditions but decouples dramatically during regulatory pressure events. When exchanges delist XMR or jurisdictions tighten privacy coin regulations, liquidity fragments across venues, creating volatility spikes and basis differentials that follow predictable patterns. The ML model ingests 30+ indicators (price dynamics, momentum, volatility, volume patterns, BTC correlation strength, and cross-exchange spread anomalies) to learn which combinations actually predict these regime shifts. Traditional BTC-following strategies fail exactly when they matter most - during regulatory-driven decoupling events where XMR's unique risk profile dominates price action. The system retrains weekly because Monero's regulatory environment evolves rapidly, and feature importance rankings reveal what's actually driving predictions across accumulation, markup, distribution, and markdown phases.

## Overview

This is a multi-strategy ensemble trading bot designed for Monero (XMR) markets:

1. **Market Cycle XGBoost** - Machine learning strategy using 30+ market cycle indicators (adapted from Bitcoin cycle indicators) to predict XMR price movements. Includes Pi Cycle, Mayer Multiple, Rainbow Chart, momentum indicators, volatility metrics, and cross-asset correlation with BTC. Uses XGBoost to learn complex patterns across all indicators simultaneously. See `docs/MARKET-CYCLE-XGBOOST.md` for details.

2. **BTC-XMR Correlation** - Tests for correlation between Bitcoin and Monero price movements with dynamic lag detection. Hypothesis: XMR may lag BTC movements due to lower liquidity and fragmented exchange availability. Exploits correlation inefficiencies for entry signals.

3. **Development Activity Analysis** - Monitors GitHub repositories (Monero, Zcash, other privacy coins) tracking PRs, commits, and contributor activity to assess feature readiness and crisis management patterns that may signal upcoming price catalysts. Uses sentiment analysis on development activity as a leading indicator. Yes, this is a very noisy signal, but becomes relevant in cases like Qubit's alleged 51% attack.

## How It Works

### Main Trading Loop
The bot runs on a configurable interval (default: every 2 hours):

1. Fetch OHLCV data from exchanges (Binance, Kraken) for both XMR and BTC
2. Calculate 30+ market cycle indicators and engineer features
3. Run all enabled strategies in parallel:
   - **Market Cycle XGBoost**: Analyzes all 30+ indicators simultaneously using ML to predict BUY/SELL/HOLD with confidence scores. Includes Pi Cycle, Mayer Multiple, RSI variants, volatility metrics, volume analysis, and cross-asset correlation with BTC.
   - **BTC Correlation**: Checks BTC price changes across multiple time windows and tests for lag correlation to identify when XMR follows BTC movements with exploitable delays.
   - **Development Monitoring**: Analyzes GitHub activity (PRs, commits, contributor patterns) across privacy coin repositories to identify feature readiness and crisis response signals that may precede price movements.
4. Aggregate signals via weighted voting (configurable weights)
5. Apply risk management (position sizing, exposure checks, stop losses)
6. Execute orders if signal strength > threshold
7. Update Prometheus metrics, send Telegram alerts

Strategy signals are combined through an adaptive weighting system that adjusts based on recent performance and market conditions.

## Requirements

### Minimum Setup
- Python 3.10+
- PostgreSQL 14+ (trade history, signals)
- Redis 7+ (caching, task queue)
- InfluxDB 2.0+ (time-series market data)
- Exchange API keys (Binance OR Kraken)
- Telegram bot token (alerts)

### Optional (Development Monitoring)
- GitHub API access (free with rate limits, or GitHub token for higher limits)
- Optional: OpenAI API key ($10-20/month) OR Anthropic API key for LLM-based pattern analysis

### For ML Strategy (Market Cycle XGBoost)
- 8GB+ RAM for XGBoost training (16GB+ recommended)
- 5-10 minutes for initial model training

## Current Limitations

1. **Market Cycle XGBoost**:
   - Not pre-trained (trains on first run, takes 5-10 minutes)
   - Requires 2 years of historical data for best accuracy (downloads automatically)
   - Needs both XMR and BTC data for cross-asset analysis
   - Weekly retraining recommended to adapt to market changes

2. **Development Monitoring Strategy**:
   - Tracks PRs, commits, and contributor activity across privacy coin repositories
   - Signals feature readiness (major releases) and crisis response patterns
   - GitHub API is free with rate limits (or use token for higher limits)
   - Optional LLM analysis for pattern classification ($10-50/month)

3. **BTC Correlation Strategy**:
   - Works best during periods of high BTC-XMR correlation
   - May generate false signals during market decoupling events
   - Lag detection requires sufficient price movement history
